    "Consider the Allais-Samuelson-Diamond OLG model with capital. An agent (born young at date $t \\in \\mathbb{N}$) consumes $c_{y,t}$ when young and $c_{o,t+1}$ when old. There is an infinite set of such agents on the interval $[0,1]$. The date-$t$ young agent has a preference ordering over $(c_{y,t}, c_{o,t+1})$ streams which is represented by the felicity function:\n",
